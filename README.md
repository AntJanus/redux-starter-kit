## Redux with React Starter Kit

The simplest getting started kit I could create.

### Features

- sample action
- sample reducer
- sample middleware
- sample store
- sample React component
- all wired together

### Prerequisites

The basics:

- Node
- NPM
- Gulp

### To run

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

and open the `index.html` file in `build` folder. The browser should say "It's running" when the file is opened. That means that everything is working correctly.

### What this doesn't include

- testing
- npm scripts
- hot reloading
- React/Redux devtools
- many other things
